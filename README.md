# FAST-NUCES-Lahore-Faculty-Web-Scraping-Assignment

This was an assignment given to me in my 3rd semester of BS(Data Science), the task was to create 11 files for the faculty data for all 5 departments of FAST NUCES Lahore. 5 files for the faculty data and 5 more for the profile of each faculty member. And one last last file that integrates the data scraped into a single data set table. The csv files created have been saved into a zip file titled with my roll number as well as the Jupyter Notebook on which I wrote the code .
